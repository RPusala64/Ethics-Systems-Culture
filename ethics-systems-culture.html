            <h2>📄 Ethical Dilemma Response</h2>
            <p>The supervisor of an information technology unit in a medium-sized company
                frequently imposes high-visibility work on a small pool of its members. These are competent
                individuals who are not the sole people who can carry out such activities.</p>

            <h2>🔁 Causal Loop Diagram</h2>
            <p>This diagram presents a feedback loop model that shows how internal workplace dynamics impact customer
                outcomes. Strong Supervisor Communication boosts Employee Morale, enhancing Productivity & Efficiency
                and Output Quality, which reduces Escalation Frequency and improves Response Time (MBAYA et al., 2024).
                This leads to better Customer Satisfaction, creating a Positive Feedback Loop. </p>

            <p>Transparency is speaking plainly about expectations, decisions, and
                results. Through proper sharing of task allocation, measuring performance, and organization
                news, a misunderstanding is minimized, and a relationship of trust is attained. </p>

            <h2>🌍 Cultural Reflection</h2>
            <p>The US IT work culture is very different, and in order to adjust to it, one will have to
                learn several important aspects of the differences in communication and leadership styles.
                The process of feedback is, in an Indian working environment, received in rather
                authoritarian ways.</p>
